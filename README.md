# Noesis

**An engine for persistent worlds where truth is centralized, perception is distributed, and meaning is emergent.**

---

## Overview

Noesis is a shared reality engine designed to separate **world truth**, **perception**, and **narrative** into distinct, enforceable layers.

The core assumption behind Noesis is simple:

> A world should exist independently of what any single participant can perceive.

The engine enforces objective state and perception rules, while narrative is treated as a derived and interpretive process — human, AI-driven, or hybrid.

---

## Core concepts

### Centralized truth
The world has a single, authoritative state.
Facts are validated and enforced by the engine, not by narration or interpretation.

### Distributed perception
Each entity perceives only a subset of reality.
Visibility, interaction, and presence are governed by explicit perception rules.

### Emergent meaning
Narrative is not authored directly by the engine.
It emerges from the interaction between world state, perception, and interpretation.

## Architecture (conceptual)

Noesis is structured around three layers:

1. **World layer**  
   Objective entities, locations, rules, and constraints.

2. **Perception layer**  
   Mechanisms defining what each entity can see, hear, or interact with.

3. **Narrative layer**  
   Interpretation and description of experience, external to the core engine.

Only the first two layers are enforced by Noesis itself.

## Technology stack (current direction)

Noesis is not bound to a single implementation, but the current reference stack includes:

- **TinyMUX**  
  Used as the authoritative world and perception engine (entities, locations, Rx/Tx, reality levels).

- **Python**  
  Integration layer, tooling, orchestration, and external services.

- **Discord**  
  Primary user-facing interface for interaction and presentation.

- **AI (LLMs)**  
  Used as narrators, interpreters, or witnesses of world events — never as arbiters of truth.

## What Noesis is

- A backend engine for persistent, shared worlds  
- A system where perception is treated as data  
- A foundation for worlds with hidden layers, partial knowledge, and asymmetrical awareness  
- A platform for experiences where uncertainty and limited perception are intentional design elements  

## What Noesis is not

- A game engine with predefined mechanics  
- A chatbot-driven RPG system  
- A replacement for human or AI narration  
- A simulation assuming full observability or omniscience  

---

## Project status

Noesis is currently in an early exploratory and prototyping phase.

Current focus areas include:
- defining a stable ontological core,
- formalizing perception mechanics,
- validating the separation between truth, perception, and narrative,
- establishing a reproducible development environment.

APIs and interfaces should be considered unstable at this stage.

## Philosophy

Noesis is built around a single guiding idea:

> A world becomes more believable when it knows more than any of its inhabitants.
